Misinformation spreads faster than facts, especially on social media platforms. Your task is to build an AI-driven solution that can detect fake news or misleading content. The system should be able to assess the credibility of sources, verify factual claims, and flag content that could be harmful or deceptive. Bonus points for incorporating multilingual support or fact-checking across any one of multiple domains (such as health, politics, finance etc.). Your solution could empower media outlets, educators, and the public to fight the infodemic with confidence.
